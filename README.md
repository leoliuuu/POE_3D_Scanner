#Pandora Principles of engineering final project
##@Authors: Richard Ballaux, Leo Liu, Alison Palmer, Vienna Scheyer

## What do you need to install to run this code:
- The Arduino IDE and the SpeedyStepper built-in library
- The Processing IDE and kinect4WinSDK built-in library

## What is this code:
### Processing:
The Processing code that runs on the computer, receives depth data from a Xbox kinect scanner and processes it into a 10 by 10 matrix for the Arduino to push the blocks upward.

### Arduino:
There is a folder for the Arduino code. This Arduino receives the 10x10 array from processing and this makes the stepper motor move, make the 10 pushing servo's push up the blocks and make the other 10 servo's locking the locking plates.
